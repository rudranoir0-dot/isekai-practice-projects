# ðŸ““ Learning Log

This file tracks my daily progress while learning Python, Git, and related tools.  

---

## âœ… Day 1
- Installed **Python** & **Git**.  
- Wrote first script `hello.py`.  
- Learned basic Git workflow: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`.  

---

## âœ… Day 2
- Practiced Python loops in **REPL**.  
- Created `test_request.py` to fetch a website using the `requests` library.  
- Added `requirements.txt` for dependencies.  

---

## âœ… Day 3
- Set up `.gitignore` to ignore `venv/` & `__pycache__/`.  
- Fixed Git mistakes (temp files, wrong commits).  
- Learned about **PowerShell execution policies** & how to bypass them.  
- Created `check_site.py` (mini HTTP checker tool).
